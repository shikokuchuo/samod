//! # Samod
//!
//! `samod` is a library for building collaborative applications which work offlne
//! and don't require servers (though servers certainly can be useful). This is
//! achieved by representing data as [`automerge`](https://docs.rs/automerge/latest/automerge/)
//! documents. `samod` is wire compatible with the `automerge-repo` JavaScript library.
//!
//! ## What does all that mean?
//!
//! `samod` helps you manage automerge "documents", which are hierarchical data
//! structures composed of maps, lists, text, and primitive values - a little
//! like JSON. Every change you make to a document is recorded and you can move
//! back and forth through the history of a document - it's a bit like Git for
//! JSON. `samod` takes care of storing changes for you and synchronizing them
//! with connected peers. The interesting part is that given this very detailed
//! history which we never discard, we can merge documents with changes which
//! were made concurrently. This means that we can build applications which
//! allow multiple users to edit the same document without having to have all
//! changes go through a server.
//!
//! ## How it all works
//!
//! The library is structured around a [`Repo`], which talks to a [`Storage`]
//! instance and to which you can connect to other peers using
//! [`Repo::connect`](crate::Repo::connect). Once you have a [`Repo`] you can
//! create documents using [`Repo::create`], or look up existing docuements using
//! [`Repo::find`]. In either case you will get back a [`DocHandle`] which you can
//! use to interact with the document.
//!
//! Typically then, your workflow will look like this:
//!
//! * Initialize a `Repo` at application startup, passing it a [`RuntimeHandle`]
//!   implementation and [`Storage`] implementation
//! * Whenever you have connections available (maybe you are connecting to a
//!   sync server, maybe you are receiving peer-to-peer connections) you call
//!   [`Repo::connect`] to add connections to the repo.
//! * Create `DocHandle`s using `Repo::create` and look up existing documents
//!   using `Repo::find`
//! * Modify documents using `DocHandle::with_document`
//!
//! Let's walk through each of those steps.
//!
//! ### Initializing a [`Repo`]
//!
//! To initialize a [`Repo`] you call [`Repo::builder()`] to obtain a
//! [`RepoBuilder`] which you use to configure the repo before calling [`RepoBuilder::load()`]
//! to actually load the repository. For example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[cfg(feature="tokio")]
//! # tokio_test::block_on(async {
//! let repo = samod::Repo::builder(tokio::runtime::Handle::current())
//!     .with_storage(samod::storage::InMemoryStorage::new())
//!     .load()
//!     .await;
//! })
//! ```
//!
//! The first argument to `builder` is an implementation of [`RuntimeHandle`].
//! Default implementations are provided for `tokio` and `gio` which can be
//! conveniently used via [`Repo::build_tokio`] and [`Repo::build_gio`]
//! respectively. The [`RuntimeHandle`] trait is straightforward to implement if
//! you want to use some other async runtime.
//!
//! By default `samod` uses an in-memory storage implementation. This is great
//! for prototyping but in most cases you do actually want to persist data somewhere.
//! In this case you'll need an implementation of [`Storage`] to pass to
//! [`RepoBuilder::with_storage`]
//!
//! It is possible to use [`Storage`] and [`AnnouncePolicy`] implementations which
//! do not produce `Send` futures. In this case you will also need a runtime which
//! can spawn non-`Send` futures. See the [runtimes](#runtimes) section for more
//! details.
//!
//!
//! ### Connecting to peers
//!
//! Connections are managed via **dialers** and **acceptors** (listeners).
//!
//! - A **dialer** actively connects to a remote endpoint and automatically
//!   reconnects with exponential backoff. Create one with [`Repo::dial()`],
//!   which takes a [`BackoffConfig`] and an `Arc<dyn Dialer>`
//! - `Repo::find` will wait for any dialers which are in the process of
//!   connection to either establish a connection, or start retrying,
//!   before marking a document as unavailable. This means that as long
//!   as you add the [`Dialer`] before calling `Repo::find` you won't have to
//!   coordinate the timing of your dialers and document lookups.
//! - An **acceptor** passively accepts inbound connections. Create one with
//!   [`Repo::make_acceptor()`], then feed accepted transports via
//!   [`AcceptorHandle::accept()`].
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! // In this case we use the built in ChannelDialer which is useful for simple tests
//! // more useful implementations wrap actual network transports
//! # use samod::{BackoffConfig, Repo};
//! # use samod::transport::channel::ChannelDialer;
//! # use std::sync::Arc;
//! # async fn doit() {
//! let bob: Repo = todo!();
//! let alice: Repo = todo!();
//! let url = url::Url::parse("samod-channel://my-channel").unwrap();
//! let acceptor = bob.make_acceptor(url).unwrap();
//! let channel_dialer = ChannelDialer::new(acceptor);
//! let dialer_handle = alice.dial(BackoffConfig::default(), Arc::new(channel_dialer)).unwrap();
//! // Wait for the first successful connection + handshake
//! let peer_info = dialer_handle.established().await.unwrap();
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! #### Dialer handles
//!
//! The [`DialerHandle`] returned by [`Repo::dial()`] can be used to:
//! - Wait for the first successful connection with [`DialerHandle::established()`]
//! - Observe lifecycle events (connect, disconnect, retry, failure) with
//!   [`DialerHandle::events()`]
//! - Check if connected with [`DialerHandle::is_connected()`]
//! - Close the dialer with [`DialerHandle::close()`]
//!
//! #### Acceptor handles
//!
//! The [`AcceptorHandle`] returned by [`Repo::make_acceptor()`] can be used to:
//! - Accept inbound connections with [`AcceptorHandle::accept()`]
//! - Observe lifecycle events with [`AcceptorHandle::events()`]
//! - Check connection count with [`AcceptorHandle::connection_count()`]
//! - Close the acceptor with [`AcceptorHandle::close()`]
//!
//! ### Managing Documents
//!
//! Once you have a [`Repo`] you can use it to manage [`DocHandle`]s. A
//! [`DocHandle`] represents an [`automerge`] document which the [`Repo`]
//! is managing. "managing" here means a few things:
//!
//! * Any changes made to the document using [`DocHandle::with_document`]
//!   will be persisted to storage and synchronized with connected peers
//!   (subject to the [`AnnouncePolicy`]).
//! * Any changes received from connected peers will be applied to the
//!   document and made visible to the application. You can listen for
//!   these changes using [`DocHandle::changes`].
//!
//! To create a new document you use [`Repo::create`] which will return
//! once the document has been persisted to storage. To look up an existing
//! document you use [`Repo::find`]. This will first look in storage, then
//! if the document is not found in storage it will request the document
//! from all connected peers (again subject to the [`AnnouncePolicy`]). If
//! any peer has the document the future returned by [`Repo::find`] will
//! resolve once we have synchronized with at least one remote peer which
//! has the document.
//!
//! You can make changes to a document using [`DocHandle::with_document`].
//!
//! ### Announce Policies
//!
//! By default, `samod` will announce all the [`DocHandle`]s it is synchronizing
//! to all connected peers and will also send requests to any connected peers
//! when you call [`Repo::find`]. This is often not what you want. To customize
//! this logic you pass an implementation of [`AnnouncePolicy`] to
//! [`RepoBuilder::with_announce_policy`]. Note that `AnnouncePolicy` is implemented
//! for `Fn(&DocumentId) -> bool` so you can just pass a closure if you want.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[cfg(feature="tokio")]
//! # tokio_test::block_on(async{
//! let authorized_peer = samod::PeerId::from("alice");
//! let repo = samod::Repo::build_tokio().with_announce_policy(move |_doc_id, peer_id| {
//!    // Only announce documents to alice
//!    &peer_id == &authorized_peer
//! }).load().await;
//! # });
//! ```
//!
//! ## Runtimes
//!
//! [`RuntimeHandle`] is a trait which is intended to abstract over the various
//! runtimes available in the rust ecosystem. The most common runtime is `tokio`.
//! `tokio` is a work-stealing runtime which means that the futures spawned on it
//! must be [`Send`], so that they can be moved between threads. This means that
//! [`RuntimeHandle::spawn`] requires [`Send`] futures. This in turn means that
//! the futures returned by the [`Storage`] and [`AnnouncePolicy`] traits are
//! also [`Send`] so that they can be spawned onto the [`RuntimeHandle`].
//!
//! In many cases though, you may have a runtime which doesn't require [`Send`]
//! futures and you may have storage and announce policy implementations which
//! cannot produce [`Send`] futures. This would often be the case in single
//! threaded runtimes for example. In these cases you can instead implement
//! [`LocalRuntimeHandle`], which doesn't require [`Send`] futures and then
//! you implement [`LocalStorage`] and [`LocalAnnouncePolicy`] traits for
//! your storage and announce policy implementations. You configure all these
//! things via the [`RepoBuilder`] struct. Once you've configured the storage
//! and announce policy implementations to use local variants you can then
//! create a local [`Repo`] using [`RepoBuilder::load_local`].
//!
//! ## Concurrency
//!
//! Typically `samod` will be managing many documents. One for each [`DocHandle`]
//! you retrieve via [`Repo::create`] or [`Repo::find`] but also one for any
//! sync messages received about a particular document from remote peers (e.g.
//! a sync server would have no [`DocHandle`]s open but would still be running
//! many document processes). By default document tasks will be handled on the
//! async runtime provided to the [`RepoBuilder`] but this can be undesirable.
//! Document operations can be compute intensive and so responsiveness may
//! benefit from running them on a separate thread pool. This is the purpose
//! of the [`RepoBuilder::with_concurrency`] method, which allows you to
//! configure how document operations are processed. If you want to use the
//! threadpool approach you will need to enable the `threadpool` feature.
//!
//! ## Why not just Automerge?
//!
//! `automerge` is a low level library. It provides routines for manipulating
//! documents in memory and an abstract data sync protocol. It does not actually
//! hook this up to any kind of network or storage. Most of the work involved
//! in doing this plumbing is straightforward, but if every application does
//! it themselves, we don't end up with interoperable applications. In particular
//! we don't end up with fungible sync servers. One of the core goals of this
//! library is to allow application authors to be agnostic as to where the
//! user synchronises data by implementing a generic network and storage layer
//! which all applications can use.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! Here's a somewhat fully featured example of using `samod` to manage a todo list
//! across two repos (representing two different devices):
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[cfg(feature="tokio")]
//! # tokio_test::block_on(async {
//! use automerge::{ReadDoc, transaction::{Transactable as _}};
//! use futures::StreamExt as _;
//! use samod::{BackoffConfig, transport::channel::ChannelDialer};
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//!
//! # let _ = tracing_subscriber::fmt().try_init();
//!
//! // Create two repos, representing two different devices
//! let alice = samod::Repo::build_tokio().load().await;
//! let bob = samod::Repo::build_tokio().load().await;
//!
//! // Create an initial skeleton for our todo list on alice
//! let mut initial_doc = automerge::Automerge::new();
//! initial_doc.transact::<_, _, automerge::AutomergeError>(|tx| {
//!     let _todos = tx.put_object(automerge::ROOT, "todos", automerge::ObjType::List)?;
//!     Ok(())
//! }).unwrap();
//!
//! // Now create a `samod::DocHandle` on alice using `Repo::create`
//! let alice_handle = alice.create(initial_doc).await.unwrap();
//!
//! // Bob registers an acceptor; alice dials bob via an in-process ChannelDialer
//! let url = url::Url::parse("channel://alice-to-bob").unwrap();
//! let acceptor = bob.make_acceptor(url).unwrap();
//! let channel_dialer = ChannelDialer::new(acceptor);
//! let dialer_handle = alice.dial(BackoffConfig::default(), Arc::new(channel_dialer)).unwrap();
//!
//! // Wait for alice to be connected to bob
//! dialer_handle.established().await.unwrap();
//!
//! // Bob can now fetch alice's document
//! let bob_handle = bob.find(alice_handle.document_id().clone()).await.unwrap().unwrap();
//!
//! // Make a change on bob's side
//! bob_handle.with_document(|doc| {
//!     doc.transact(|tx| {
//!        let todos = tx.get(automerge::ROOT, "todos").unwrap()
//!           .expect("todos should exist").1;
//!        tx.insert(todos, 0, "Buy milk")?;
//!        Ok::<_, automerge::AutomergeError>(())
//!     }).unwrap();
//! });
//!
//! // Wait for the change to be received on alice's side
//! alice_handle.changes().next().await.unwrap();
//!
//! // Alice's document now reflects bob's change
//! alice_handle.with_document(|doc| {
//!     let todos = doc.get(automerge::ROOT, "todos").unwrap()
//!         .expect("todos should exist").1;
//!     let item = doc.get(todos, 0).unwrap().expect("item should exist").0;
//!     let automerge::Value::Scalar(val) = item else {
//!         panic!("item should be a scalar");
//!     };
//!     let automerge::ScalarValue::Str(s) = val.as_ref() else {
//!         panic!("item should be a string");
//!     };
//!     assert_eq!(s, "Buy milk");
//!     Ok::<_, automerge::AutomergeError>(())
//! }).unwrap();
//! # });
//! ```

/// The entry point to this library
///
/// A [`Repo`] represents a set of running [`DocHandle`]s, active connections to
/// other peers over which we are synchronizing the active [`DocHandle`]s, and
/// an instance of [`Storage`] where document data is persisted.
///
/// Individual documents require exclusive access to mutate (including receiving
/// sync messages). In order to make this non-blocking the `Repo` spawns a
/// task for each document on an underlying threadpool. All method calls on
/// the `Repo` can consequently be called in asynchronous contexts as they do
/// not block.
///
/// ## Lifecycle
///
/// To obtain a [`Repo`] call [`Repo::builder`] (or the various `Repo::build_*`
/// variants specific to different runtimes) to obtain a [`RepoBuilder`] and
/// then call [`RepoBuilder::load`] to actually load the [`Repo`].
///
/// Once you have a repo you can connect new network connections to it using
/// [`Repo::connect`]. You can create new documents using [`Repo::create`] and
/// lookup existing documents using [`Repo::find`].
///
/// When you are finished with a [`Repo`] you can call [`Repo::stop`] to flush
/// everything to storage before shutting down the application.
